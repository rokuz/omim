<p>
It happens millions of times each week – a customer receives a drink from a Starbucks barista – but each interaction is unique.
<p>
It’s just a moment in time – just one hand reaching over the counter to present a cup to another outstretched hand.
<p>
But it’s a connection.
<p>
We make sure everything we do honors that connection – from our commitment to the highest quality coffee in the world, to the way we engage with our customers and communities to do business responsibly.]]></description>

<p>
Ciya		
<p>													
A Garden of Lost Cultures and Forgotten Tastes
<p>
From the owner of a modest kebab restaurant, the adventure of Ciya is a journey built on passion, keen desire, research and love through the world of food.
<p>
Çiya --- like its name, brings to mind high mountain peaks and mountain flowers. In the old days when one would go only for a good kebab or a good lahmacun and those that knew the name "Çiya" could learn the meaning just by asking, a dinning experience that is known as "Çiya" was born in this nest. To this wealth of gourmet expertise a second specially set-up "Sofra" or Kebab House was added. Soon after within a few meters of each other a third "kebab house" was added, hence the three"Çiya"s.
<p>
Located in the Fish Market district of Kadiköy, where one's path will definitely be drawn to one of these establishments . The cache of culinary knowledge at Çiya which quite honestly comes from the hands of its creators or "culinary engineers"; Zeynep and Musa who make it all possible. The creators, will take you for a journey in their kitchen, rich in "dishes from a broad geographical space, spanning from Mesopotamia to the Ottomans, from the Balkans to the Caucasus and from Asia to the Arabian Peninsula."]]></description>

It has its origin in the Rila Mountains in Western Bulgaria, flowing southeast between the Balkan and Rhodope Mountains, past Plovdiv and Parvomay (where the Mechka and the Kayaliyka join it) to Edirne, Turkey. East of Svilengrad, Bulgaria, the river flows eastwards, forming the border between Bulgaria (on the north bank) and Greece (on the south bank), and then between Turkey and Greece. At Edirne, the river flows through Turkish territory on both banks, then turns towards the south and forms the border between Greece on the west bank and Turkey on the east bank to the Aegean Sea.]]></description>

<p>
	A stay in Istanbul is not complete without the traditional and unforgettable boat excursion up the Bosphorus, the winding strait that separates Europe and Asia. Its shores offer a delightful mixture of past and present, grand splendor and simple beauty. Modern hotels stand next to yali (shore-front wooden villas), marble palaces abut rustic stone fortresses, and elegant compounds neighbor small fishing villages. The best way to see the Bosphorus is to board one of our daily tours or rent one of our boats if you are traveling in a group.. If you wish a private voyage, you can contact one of the agencies which specialize in organizing day or night mini-cruises. During the journey you pass in front of the magnificent Dolmabahce Palace; farther along rise the green parks and imperial pavilions of Yildiz Palace. On the edge of this park, on the coast, stands the Ciragan Palace now restored as a grand hotel. Refurbished in 1874 by Sultan Abdulaziz, it stretches for 300 meters along the Bosphorus shore, its ornate marble facades reflecting the swiftly moving water. At Ortakoy, the next stop, artists gather every Sunday to exhibit their works in a street-side gallery. The variety of people create a lively scene; sample a delicious bite from one of the street vendors. Overshadowing the traditional architecture of the village, the Bosphorus Bridge, one of the world's largest suspension bridges, links Europe and Asia.
<p>
The beautiful Beylerbeyi Palace lies just past the bridge on the Asian side. Behind the palace rises Camlica Hill, the highest point of Istanbul. You can drive here to admire the magnificent panorama of Istanbul as well as the beautiful landscaped gardens. On the opposite shore, the wooden Ottoman villas of Arnavutkoy contrast with the luxurious modern apartments of neighboring Bebek. A few kilometers farther out, facing each other across the straits like sentries guarding the city, stand the fortresses of Rumeli Hisari and Anadolu Hisari. The Goksu Palace, sometimes known as Kucuksu Palace graces the Asian-shore next to the Anadolu Hisari. The recently completed second link between the two continents, the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge straddles the waterway just past the two fortresses. 
<p>
From Duatepe Hill, on the European side, you can admire the magnificent panorama of the bridge and the Bosphorus. Below Duatepe, the beautiful Emirgan Park with its delightful pavilions bursts with color when the tulips bloom in the spring. Opposite on the Asian shore is Kanlica, a fishing village now a favored suburb for wealthy Istanbulites. Crowds gather in the restaurants and cafes along its shores to sample its famous yogurt. Shortly after Kanlica, at Cubuklu, the Hidiv Palace emerges from a tranquil grove. Now a hotel, the palace buzzes with the activity of concerts and conferences. Past the Hidiv Palace, the Beykoz Korusu (Abraham Pasa) Korusu Woods are a popular retreat. Complete with cafes and restaurants you can enjoy the delightful views and clear fresh air. On the European side, at Tarabya Bay, yachts seem to dance at their moorings. The coast road bustles with taverns and fish restaurants from Tarabya until the charming villages of Buyukdere and Sariyer. A little further on the narrow strait widens and disappears into the Black Sea. 
<p>
The Golden Horn, a horn-shaped estuary, divides European Istanbul. One of the best natural harbors in the world, the Byzantine and Ottoman navies and commercial shipping interests were centered here. Today, lovely parks and promenades line the shores. In the setting sun, the water shines a golden color. At Fener, a neighborhood midway up the Golden Horn, whole streets of old wooden houses and churches date from Byzantine times. The Orthodox Patriarchy resides here. Eyup, a little further up, reflects the Ottoman style of vernacular architecture. Cemeteries sprinkled with dark cypress trees cover the hillsides. It is always busy here with pilgrims coming to the tomb of Eyup in the hope that their prayers will be granted. The Pierre Loti Cafe atop the hill overlooking the shrine is a wonderful place to enjoy the tranquillity of the view.]]></description>

<a href=" http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul ">Istanbul</a>
<p>
Istanbul (/ˌɪstænˈbuːl/; Turkish: İstanbul [isˈtanbuɫ]) is the largest city in Turkey, constituting the country's economic, cultural, and historical heart. Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, with its commercial and historical centre lying on the European side and about a third of its population living on the Asian side of Eurasia. With a population of 14.4 million, the city forms the largest urban agglomeration in Europe as well as the largest in the Middle East, and the sixth-largest city proper in the world. Istanbul's vast area of 5,343 square kilometers (2,063 sq mi) is coterminous with Istanbul Province, of which the city is the administrative capital. Istanbul straddles the Bosphorus strait in northwestern Turkey, between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea.
<p>
Founded on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660 BC as Byzantium, the city now known as Istanbul developed to become one of the most significant cities in history. For nearly sixteen centuries following its reestablishment as Constantinople or Nea Romi ("New Rome") in 330 AD, it served as an imperial capital for the Roman (330–395), the Byzantine (395–1204 and 1261–1453), the Latin (1204–1261), and the Ottoman (1453–1922) empires. It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times, before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate.
<p>
Istanbul's strategic position along the historic Silk Road, rail networks to Europe and the Middle East, and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have helped foster an eclectic populace, although less so since the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Overlooked for the new capital during the interwar period, the city has since regained much of its prominence. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s, as migrants from across Anatolia have flocked to the metropolis and city limits have expanded to accommodate them. Arts festivals were established at the end of the 20th century, while infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network.
<p>
Approximately 11.6 million foreign visitors arrived in Istanbul in 2012, two years after it was named a European Capital of Culture, making the city the world's fifth-most-popular tourist destination. The city's biggest draw remains its historic center, partially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its cultural and entertainment hub can be found across the city's natural harbor, the Golden Horn, in the Beyoğlu district. Considered a global city, Istanbul is one of the fastest-growing metropolitan economies in the world. It hosts the headquarters of many Turkish companies and media outlets and accounts for more than a quarter of the country's gross domestic product. Hoping to capitalize on its revitalization and rapid expansion, Istanbul bid for the Summer Olympics five times in twenty years.]]></description>
