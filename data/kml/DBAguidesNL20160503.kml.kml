On the ANWB chart - Passantehhaven Molenstreek.<br> Mooring: Very new harbour with 300m alongside mooring on staging with posts and numerous boxes for smaller craft.<br> Essentials: Electricity, Water, Rubbish disposal<br> Costs: â‚¬5 (25m, no electricity)<br> Amenities: The haven is almost in the middle of town with a large shopping centre nearby..<br> Contributors: Quo Vadis 25x1 7/12<br> Remarks: A pleasant mooring and town with a friendly Harbour/lock/bridgemaster.  Entrance from the north is dramatic - with a closed bridge ahead, the entrance to stb is almost invisible and quite narrow, into a lock.  There is also a sharp right-angle turn, in the haven <br> A hand-turned railway bridge used by a steam-railway lies between the lock and haven. This is closed for periods while the trains are running, so there may be a long wait in the lock before entering the haven if arriving from the N after ~3pm.<br> Boats are taken through the bridges of Veendam in two convoys, starting 8/9am and 1pm, taking about 2 hours to reach the Stadskanaal - with another right-angle turn to pt immediately after a road bridge.<br> Last Update: 06-01-2013 - Mooring Index: 7162 - Version: 3<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

To gain entrance the lockkeeper uses his little boat to move a floating barrier out of the way.  When you enter Amsterdam centre you must report to this lock to state your intentions and pay your mooring fees.  To do this you tie up in the spaces provided either side of the lockkeepers house in the centre of the lock and go in to see the duty lockkeeper.  Be very nice!  They control the mooring.  Ask if you can stay.  Make sure to  point out to the lockkeeper you are: ?at moving houseboat? not a yacht as yachts pay three times as much and can only stay 3 days.  A call to the lock before you enter the city might tell you if space is available to moor.  Very busy in season but not out of season.<br> Last Update: 13-07-2012 - Mooring Index: 2117 - Version: 1<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016. For use of DBA members only.]]></description>

There are few mooring places near Werkendam and it is quite a long way to the next places on the Maas. The main attraction is that it is quiet and remote - occasional boats pass by, but there is no contact with the land. Very peaceful Oct to Mar and much busier in the summer. The E-W channel from this mooring to PK 261 on the Amer is winding and very shallow in places - be careful.<br> Last Update: 23-05-2012 - Mooring Index: 5110 - Version: 3<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

Mooring space is correspondingly in demand at peak times and limited to the places listed, other waterways being used by houseboats. . <br> Construction of the new Trompbrug at the junction with the Eems Kanaal and Van Starkenborgh Kanaal is causing alteration to former moorings east of Oosterhavenbrug. <br> Note that it can take a while (up to a couple of hours) to get into and out of Groningen due to bridge timings.We have stayed in Groningen twice and much enjoyed it.

We were told the passentenhaven is shallow and were invited to moor alongside a commercial barge for an overnight stay. Small barges could use the passentenhaven but you are not allowed to moor on the "outside" of the long jetty (on the left as you approach). There are more reliable moorings available just downstream of Zutphen - 15km or so to the north and an anchorage can be found in the gravel pits and lakes to the west which are entered through a narrow channel at PK 896.7. <br> Last Update: 23-02-2010 - Mooring Index: 5084 - Version: 1<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

VIRUNGA 28x1.3m (2009)<br> Remarks: VW de Mars is a much better bet for a barge than the popular Vispoorthaven, 500m upstream of the bridge, which has a truly wicked entrance from the current in the river. The  Vispoorthaven, being closer to the centre of the town, tends to fill up with cruisers early in the day and backing a barge out into the current in the river can be somewhat interesting. The Gelderse Ijssel is a long, hard slog going upstream and, if doing a round trip, it is worth planning to sail down river rather than going against the current. Generally, the current is strongest above Doesburg and weakens further downstream as the river widens out. <br> Last Update: 23-02-2010 - Mooring Index: 5085 - Version: 2<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

			<description><![CDATA[Waterway: Maas<br> Mooring: Rating Adequate<br> Lat/Long: 051°44.93N , 005°48.15E<br> Reference: PK 167<br> Location: The entrance to the Kraaijenbergse Plassen is on the left bank of the Maas and is directly opposite the PK167 marker on the right bank. Go through the flood gate into the Industriehaven Cuijk and immediately turn right and past the gravel depot towards the first bridge. Continue through the next two bridges to get to the lake itself and the recreational moorings.<br> Mooring: The northern shore of Kraaijenbergse Plassen has four mooring places marked on the ANWB L & M charts. These become obvious on the right after passing the third bridge from the Maas. <br> Very low wooden walls with wooden mooring posts. The wooden walls and posts were replaced in May 2014 and are in excellent condition. It appears there was some dredging at that time. Shallow areas at each end of  the mooring locations.  From the bridge, <br> The first chart marker has 2 location:  'Depth1.2 meters 50 cm from shore<br> The second chart marker has 2 locations: (2a) - best pick, 30m 1.2m depth,;(2b) - 30m, 1.2m+,<br> The third chart marker (due W of JH Brasser) is 100m and left of centre has the best depth and wall conditions, gap of 1m to reach shore. <br> The fourth chart marker doesn't have shore moorings for barges.<br> JH Brasser has a long pontoon for deeper boats.<br> Essentials: Rubbish disposal, Chandlery<br> Facilities: Rubbish bins with "letterbox" lids<br> Costs: 7 days free at all locations - refer to yellow sign at 1a (2012)<br> Amenities: Linden has a chandlery next to the taven and a pancake restaurent - over 3rd bridge.<br> Cuijk is 8km with a good train service. Two supermarkets: Jumbo - Nth Cuijk 5kms & <br> AH next to the train station 8 kms. The cafes in Beers don't open until 16.00 weekdays.<br> Contributors: Henrietta, 20x1.1 4/09; Quo Vadis, 25x0.8 11/11; Jantina 20x1 4/12;  Dankbaarheid 25x1.1 5/15;<br> Remarks: The map marker is located at the 3rd chart mooring. Some barges moor bow-to in unofficial moorings. There are also moorings on the right after the 2nd bridge but there are fairly close to the A73 motorway and don't appear suitable for barges. The Plassen are working gravel pits being changed into a water sport centre and commercial boats pass by day and night. The entrance channel to the lakes is busy and care is needed entering or leaving.<br> Last Update: 06-05-2015 - Mooring Index: 5066 - Version: 4<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

In 2014, the moorings are administered by the harbourmaster from the Municipal Marina which is between the two lifting bridges and across the main road which runs along Zwarte Water<br> Essentials: Electricity, Water, WiFi internet, Rubbish disposal, Chandlery, Shipyard<br> Facilities: Electricity on the quay and on the wooden pontoon. There are two large marinas nearby with all the facilities. There are also shipyards and a hydraulics factory within a couple of km. There is a Chandlery less than 100metres from the quay.

Summer 2014 it was indeed busy. However people seem to come and go all the time so it is largely a matter of luck.<br> Do not try to get the Grote Sluis bridges lifted. They work but are only opened in exceptional circumstances.<br> Last Update: 12-07-2014 - Mooring Index: 5086 - Version: 3<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

JH Valkenberg is just past the rowing and small cruiser club on the left. Mooring is directly outside the restaurant where there is room for one barge - although two can moor doubled up. (2) Right bank below Nelson Mandelabrug, at the western extremity of the Arnhem quays PK 884.<br> Mooring: (1) Floating, rather rough, pontoon. Cleats. (2) Bollards just upstream of residential barges and downstream of the landing pontoon for a hotel ship. It is a tight fit and there is just enough space for one 30m barge.<br> Facilities: Unknown - apart from the restaurant at (1) (2) None but friendly residential barge owners provided a water-hose at no cost.<br> Costs: (1) Pay amount NK. (2) None collected by the harbourmaster; he said he would return later but never did -although we were there for five days.<br> Amenities: .All the facilities one would expect of a city 2km from (1), 500m from (2).  It is of course the centre for pilgrimages to the battlefields, museums and war cemeteries of the Battle of Arnhem; there are several such interesting places and it is well worth a visit<br> Contributors: Henrietta, 20x1.1m, 05/2009. VIRUNGA 28x1.3m (2009)<br> Remarks: The restaurant at (1) is well worth the diversion - if a bit pricey. <br> The entire quay-front (2) of Arnhem is almost permanently reserved for  the constant procession of large hotel barges, and reservation signs are placed along the jetty indicating their arrivals and departures.  All berthing is policed diligently by the (friendly) harbourmaster and any vessel visiting Arnhem is required to call him on VHF Ch 12 (office hours only) prior to going alongside; pre-booking is recommended. Youngsters gather around this berth in the evening with their cars. Mostly they sit around and smoke and talk, but some do make noise;  residential barge owners complain frequently and the police do occasional patrols.<br> Last Update: 08-03-2010 - Mooring Index: 5083 - Version: 1<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

Moorings are in the Coolhaven: Nth bank between Pieter de Hoochbrug and Lage Erfburg and the Delfshavense: both banks between Lage Erfburg & Beukelsbrug.<br> Mooring: Both havens have over 2klms of quay with 15m spaced bollards. <br> 2014 update: There are no signs relating to mooring. However, you cannot stay anywhere here. We stopped in July 2014 and could not believe how good it was with literally kilometres of quays, excellent bollards, choices of location. But there were no other boats when everywhere else in the NL is really crowded. We found out soon enough when we were visited by the Port Authority who asked us to move. They said that under the legislation, you can only moor places where it is specifically allowed and because there is no signage in this area, you must not moor there. They allowed us to finish our shopping at the excellent Jumbo and told us to moor at the waiting area for the Sluis and that this was the only place we could go (apart from listed marinas). They were very pleasant throughout and also told the lock keeper that the Ports Authority authorised us to be there until the next day's tides were right. They know the DBA and we promised to update the mooring guide accordingly. They are likely to allow a short shopping trip but definitely no overnighting. They confirmed they are unlikely to fine you but will move you out of the area and make sure you comply (as they did with us). No explanation as to why all this quay cannot be used other than "those are the regulations".<br> Essentials: Rubbish disposal, Chandlery<br> Facilities: None<br> Costs: None - we stayed 4 days in 2012. Staying NOT allowed in 2014.<br> Amenities: All shops, Jumbo supermarket 500m W of Lage Erfbrug<br> Correct Marine (6klms NE) discount chandlers with extensive range.<br> Contributors: Jantina 20x1 6/12;  Quo Vadis 25x1 10/12;  Anja 17x0.9 7/14;<br> Remarks: 2014 update- you cannot stay here. <br> <br> Best location - Coolhaven Nth bank.

Mooring space is correspondingly in demand at peak times and limited to the places listed, other waterways being used by houseboats The Aa, which is the old harbour between Noorder & Zuider havens, is highly recommended for a quiet, picturesque mooring in the town centre, though not charted as a mooring so less well used by visitors. <br> Construction of the new Trompbrug at the junction with the Eems Kanaal and Van Starkenborgh Kanaal is causing alteration to former moorings east of Oosterhavenbrug. We understand that there may be moorings available by arrangement with the Haven Meester on east bank of the Reitdiep on Hoog Der A in summer when charter sailing barges are absent.<br> Note that it can take a while (up to a couple of hours) to get into and out of Groningen due to bridge timings.<br> Last Update: 26-08-2015 - Mooring Index: 2169 - Version: 6<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

You pass typical marinas on the canal on the way in, but the setting here is superb.<br> It is also possible to stay at the Royal Navy Yacht Club immediatey west of the mouth of the main harbor. It's a long way from town, but has the advantage of no locks or bridges between one and the sea.<br> Mooring: The moorings are situated in the old Naval Dockyard on long pontoons.  The bridge connecting the basin to the canal system is always open.<br> The lock from the main harbor (Zeedoksluis, opens on demand)  maybe 30m long. The Almanak speaks of delays, but we experienced none in Aug 2015.<br> Essentials: Electricity, Water, Fuel, WiFi internet, Pumpout, Waste oil disposal, Bilge water disposal, Rubbish disposal, Chandlery, Wintering possible<br> Facilities: All the normal facilities are easily accessible.

Very interesting, and a must for our ex grey funnel line members.  The LIfeboat museum is also in the dockyard.<br> Contributors: Bertillac 17x0.8 6/14; Neeltje 22x1.1 8/14; Barbara 19 x 1.45 8/15;<br> Remarks: The Zeedoksluis connecting the basin to the sea is available with about half hours notice.  We booked 3 hours early for the tide and the lock was prepared ready for us on time.<br> The old naval dockyard had a moat around it  and all the enclosed area is being renovated with museums, art works, cinema and restaurants.  Very interesting mooring, can just see the tops of the vessels in the commercial harbour.  Great walks possible on the dyke with views across to Texel.<br> Ferry to Texel -1km away - hourly â‚¬2.50pp return (dogs travel free)<br> Last Update: 26-08-2015 - Mooring Index: 8337 - Version: 3<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

The adjacent jetties appear to be waiting berths for the bridge.<br> Facilities: Picnic table<br> Costs: None<br> Amenities: None<br> Contributors: Henrietta, 02x1.1m, 07/2009<br> Remarks: The Sneeker meer has many mooring places. We picked this one to wait for the bridge meester to finish his afternoon tea but you can stay overnight although is is a bit exposed to westerllies. More sheltered moorings are in the smaller lakes and islands in the north east, towards Akkrum particularly around the Koude Maag and the Meinesloot. Be careful, although this is a place with hundreds of pleasure boats in shallow water there are a surprising number of commercial barges going to and from the Akkrum industrial port and on to Heerenveen.<br> Last Update: 11-07-2015 - Mooring Index: 5289 - Version: 1<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

			<description><![CDATA[Waterway: Spaarne<br> Mooring: Rating Adequate<br> Lat/Long: 052°21.85N , 004°38.22E<br> Location: E bank half way between Schouwbroekerbrug and Buitenrustbrug, just pass the Marco Polo scout boat coming from the Sth. <br> Mooring: Two locations: (1) Sth pontoon 50m long with small bollards, labelled 'Passagiervaart' with a very low section labelled 'Kanoes'.  (2) Nth pontoon (300m further on) 40m long with small bollards<br> Essentials: Electricity, Rubbish disposal<br> Facilities: Unmetered electricity on the Sth pontoon only. <br> Costs: Yes, if the harbourmaster happens to pass, <br> (2012) 20m -13 euros/night and this included the Haarlem passage toll<br> Amenities: 15 min cycle to Haarlem (2Mi) for all shops.  Shopping centre to the E in Schalkwijk,a little closer.<br> Contributors: Quo Vadis 22x1, Jul 10 & Oct 10; Jantina 20x1, Jul 12;<br> Remarks: A convenient stopover if late arriving at Haarlem from the S.   The must-be-seen Cruquius pumping station and central Haarlem are in easy reach by bike. Trees at the Sth pontoon affect satelite reception, the Nth pontoon is unlikely to be affected but no electricity.<br> Last Update: 15-07-2012 - Mooring Index: 5945 - Version: 2<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

			<description><![CDATA[Waterway: Spaarne<br> Mooring: Rating Very Good<br> Lat/Long: 052°22.85N , 004°38.67E<br> Location: Various quaysides and pontoons throughout the town between Prinsenbrug and Buitenrustbrug.<br> Mooring: Mainly 1.5m high quayside with a few low pontoons . Small white bollards or rings on the quaysides. Principal moorings with services are <br> (1) above Catherijnbrug: pontoon on L bank (50m, Wt, Water), wall on L bank (200m, Elect). <br> (3) above the Melkbrug, long pontoon on L bank & long wall on R bank<br> The high quaysides have either small bollards, rings or street furniture to tie to. <br> Contact Haarlem Havendienst on Ch 18 or +31(0)23-5310904 or visit the HavenKantoor N of Prinsenbrug for berthing instructions if large or take pot luck.<br> Essentials: Electricity, Water, Fuel, Rubbish disposal, Chandlery<br> Facilities: Electricity and/or water are available at some moorings. Electricity is included in mooring fee and generator use is forbidden.  Some power connections are plug in ad rotate by 45 degreees to turn on power. Red button switches off.  Water is available for filling at numerous points (Yellow hoses). Fuel & gas barge just N of Prinsenbrug on the W bank (very expensive!). Very helpful chandler on the W bank by the Melkbruk<br> Costs: â‚¬24 for 15-25metres (2015) including unlimited electricity & water.  This includes the dues which are liable if you just pass through the town.  After mooring you can expect a visit from the harbour staff - or visit the harbour office N of Prinsenbrug.<br> Amenities: Everything!  Most town centre shops are expensive clothes/shoes/etc and more practical things harder to find.  There are supermarkets a) on Kruis Straat, one block S of the Nieuwe Gracht on the route from the centre to the station and b) in a useful shopping street just to the E of Korte Dijk & Houtmarkt. At the latter are also a postoffice, baker, butcher, ice-cream, hardware & computer shops.<br> Contributors: Quo Vadis 25x1 7/10; Actief 22x1.1 8/10; Quo Vadis 25x1 6/11; Quo Vadis 25x1 9/12;  Anja 17x4.4x0.9 07/14; Neeltje 22x1,1 8/15<br> Remarks: If coming from the North stop at the Havenmeester office to pay dues collect free maps and be allocated a mooring.  Be prepared for the plan to change at each bridge!  We were allocated a mooring on Donke Spaarne - signed for charter boats but signs changed later that evening to passenthaven.<br> <br> The Korte Dijk / Houtmarkt just S of Caterijnebrug on the E bank is my recommendation for larger barges if you have the choice as it has electricity and water, nearby practical shops and friendly neighbours. <br> <br> Haarlem itself has many attractions to justify a long stay, above all the Grote Markt, the Grote Kerk (Bavo's) the Teyler's & Frans Hals museums and the many Hofje (almshouse) gardens,  It is also a good base for visiting Amsterdam, 20 minutes away on the frequent trains, and for cycle trips to the N Sea coast and national park in the dunes..<br> Last Update: 14-08-2015 - Mooring Index: 5946 - Version: 5<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

At Industriebrug moor in wachtsplat  to port and call the harbour master - telephone number and hours of operation on bridge.<br> <br> Once through the bridge continue for 1 km until you reach the junction. The lifting bridge on the left gives access. The distance between the bridges on the port & starboard is 30 metres. 22m barges can turn at rest with ease.<br> Mooring: Moorings on both sides of this canal  in  residential area are reserved for visitors  mooring with a turning point on the corner for 25m barges.<br> Rings at 10m intervals. Wooden fendering. Good height shell and gravel walkway.<br> Essentials: Electricity, Water, Rubbish disposal, Chandlery, Repairs, Shipyard<br> Facilities: Water and electricity is on a coin operated basis. Bring plenty of 50Cent coins . It is about 500 metres from the train station. Very convenient. You can bring your bike on the train. Fuel can be delivered by tanker.<br> <br> SRF and other yards on way in from Van Harinxma<br> Costs: Harlingen has a name for being expensive and it is for short day stays but there is a paradox. Long stay can be cheaper than short stays The harbour master is very accommodating and likes barges. He will " round" the length down. Our 29 metre boat cost â‚¬325 for  prime 3 months - June July August but would have cost the same for a few days. Book a long stay<br> <br> 06/2015 - â‚¬25 per night including tourist tax. Electricity and Water on meter 50c coins.<br> Amenities: Plenty of good shops for all types of supplies. This is a town with a long shipping tradition. Get all your chandlery at the fishing harbour and ignore the "yachting shops " in the old harbour<br> Contributors: Shlee Ella 29.25x1 6/08 ; Neeltje 22x1.1 6/15;<br> Remarks: Thiis a town in which one could happily spend a complete season and still not see all the relevant places of interest. A great town for a DBA rally if enough boats would travel.<br> <br> Neeltje - The main harbour entrance is a fun place to be to watch the boats going in and out from the Waddensee.  An historic town with good shops.  This mooring is part of the main dog-walking area - good if you like dogs!<br> Last Update: 13-06-2015 - Mooring Index: 5063 - Version: 2<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

Almanac states 15m but they will take up to 30m.<br> Essentials: Electricity, Water, Rubbish disposal, Wintering possible<br> Facilities: (1) None, (2) Water & Electictiy<br> Costs: Summer - refer to Almanac. [June 2014] We were charged 1.50/m + 1.12 per person tourist tax in the harbour. A very emphatic NO to any Historic Ship discount (we are 111years) and he said this is not available to anyone. The "historic piles" are about 11metres apart so tying a bigger barge to this pontoon is a little messy and you sit about 30-40cm off the pontoon so might need to jump a little to disembark. Unmetered water and electricity are included in the price.<br> Amenities: Number of restaurants. Ferry (pay onboard 2euros 2014) to Gorinchem half hourly - city with  train station, most shops (but chandlery closed end 2013).<br> Small white boats spoil the historic ambience a little when everythging else is old or old looking. 25 Historic ships and good looking restaurant in the harbour.<br> Contributors: Jantina 20x1 4/12;  Anja 17x0.9 6/14;<br> Remarks: The canal is used by commercials but is very wide. The outside pontoon is protected from Waal wash.<br> Last Update: 08-07-2014 - Mooring Index: 6895 - Version: 3<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

			<description><![CDATA[Waterway: Waddensea<br> Mooring: Rating Very Good<br> Lat/Long: 053°02.78N , 004°51.57E<br> Location: The mooring for longer boats is clearly sign posted and is on a pontoon at the northern end of the Jachthaven.  The entrance from the fishing harbour to the jachthaven is quite well hidden, the passage to the berth is quite tight and could be difficult for full size boats in a wind.  It may be worth trying the Gemente harbour.<br> Mooring: Pontoon, with space for 25 meter boats to turn easily.<br> Essentials: Electricity, Water, Fuel, WiFi internet, Pumpout, Waste oil disposal, Bilge water disposal, Rubbish disposal, Chandlery, Repairs, Shipyard, Dock<br> Facilities: Chandler is run by the fishing CooP and so has some of the larger bits and pieces. There is a floating dock, run by DAMEN which seemed busy with the fishing fleet and coasting vessels.<br> Costs: See Almanac for current prices, but expensive though everything is included.<br> Amenities: Buses to either end of the island stop in the harbour.  Some very good restaurants, Small supermarket.in the village. Nature reserve for birds within walking distance of the haven.<br> Contributors: Bertillac 17x0.8 6/14<br> Remarks: the website www.waddenhavens.nl gives lots of good info about tides, passage planning, and berth availability.  Can be very busy on holidays, we had 5 boats outside us.<br> Last Update: 22-06-2014 - Mooring Index: 8338 - Version: 1<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

			<description><![CDATA[Waterway: Waddensea<br> Mooring: Rating Very Good<br> Lat/Long: 053°17.80N , 005°05.30E<br> Location: The haven is easy to find.  The layout has changed since the Goolge maps image and the space for the larger bosts is at the north west corner. The commercial area at the south east corner is full with charter sailing boats but may be possible.  The pilot notes warn of a back eddy in the haven mouth on the flood tide which even caught out the future King.  It would seem there is a recognised anchorage just past the ferry terminal which does not dry and is within dingy ride of the shops.<br> Mooring: Strong pontoon with ample services.  Easy access from the haven to the woods and beach for great walks.<br> Essentials: Electricity, Water, Fuel, WiFi internet, Pumpout, Waste oil disposal, Bilge water disposal, Rubbish disposal<br> Facilities: All the facilities have been upgraded and are in good condition.<br> Costs: See Almanac for current prices but expensive, though all services are free.<br> Amenities: The town has a few restaurants and a bakers, supermarket.  Enough for most things.<br> Contributors: Bertillac 17x0.8 6/14;<br> Remarks: A very relaxed island, no cars, great walks on wide clean beaches, Bus service to the other end of the island for the larger nature reserve.  A superb place to chill out.<br> Last Update: 22-06-2014 - Mooring Index: 8339 - Version: 1<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016. For use of DBA members only.]]></description>

Though the havenmeister in an inflatable is usually around.  The harbour outside the marina is usually busy with charter boats but it may be worth approaching the main havenmeister to see if a berth is possible.  The beach to the south of the town seems to be a popular place to dry out.<br> Mooring: Strong new pontoons with good facilities.<br> Essentials: Electricity, Water, Fuel, WiFi internet, Pumpout, Waste oil disposal, Bilge water disposal, Rubbish disposal<br> Costs: See Almanac for current prices, but expensive though and services are included.<br> Amenities: Oostt Terschelling has a reasonable shopping centre, supermarket, bakers, chemist etc.  Bus to the extremities of the island are regular.<br> Contributors: Bertillac 17x0.8 6/14;<br> Remarks: A bit busier than Vlieland but still a very relaxed place.  Look out for the Oerol festival, which is a arts/ music festival covering the whole island, sort of Edinburgh on sea.  There are long walks on the beaches and there are woods adjacent to the haven.<br> Last Update: 22-06-2014 - Mooring Index: 8340 - Version: 1<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.

Railway station w. connection to Schiphol airport. Small hotel at the canal side.<br> Contributors: ASLAUG 24x1.2 4/14;Anja 17x0.9 6/14;<br> Remarks: Good place to wait for guests or for a calm Sunday to cross the Amsterdam-Rijn canal.  (NB Sunday airdraft is limited to 3.4m at De Uitkomst bridgeg in winter). If going to Schipol, it is best to take the direct service which bypasses Amsterdam (20mins). Train to Amsterdam Centraal is 17mins. If you want ANWB charts, the best bet is to take the train to Hilversum(15mins) and then a few hundred metres walk as Amsterdam ANWBs are too far away. Helpful VVV office just around the corner plus a well equipped hardware store.<br> If East and West moorings are full, there are dozens of other 3x24 unserviced moorings in between. Several hundred metres of quays with good bollards.<br> Last Update: 22-09-2014 - Mooring Index: 8138 - Version: 3<br> Copyright DBA The Barge Association 2016.
