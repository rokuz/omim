Today some of Europe's most bold contemporary architecture, such as the unique Cube Houses, can be found amid classic 18th and 19th C buildings in this, the greatest comeback city in the world.

In everyday speech the locals refer to it as simply Peter. It is the second largest city in Russia and is regarded as the most Western city of Russia as a large number of foreign consulates, international corporations, banks and other businesses are located in St Petersburg. They make a striking contrast with the historically older buildings such as the Peter and Paul Fortress built in 1703.<br></td></tr></table>]]></description>

The skyline features a dramatic blend of classical architecture and clean modernism, with Russian and Swedish influences throughout. Much more than simply the nation where saunas originated, Finland - Helsinki in particular - delights visitors with a vital sense of heritage as well as enthusiasm.<br></td></tr></table>]]></description>

It is perhaps best known for being the final resting place of the famous author, Hans Christian Andersen and, being one of the worlds most environmentally friendly cities, has also been recognised as having a very high quality of life. With many colourful buildings dating back to the early 18th century, medieval cobbled streets and canals just a stone's throw away from ultra-modern waterfront architecture, and a street plan that dates back to the Middle Ages, it captures the imagination of all visitors.<br></td></tr></table>]]></description>
